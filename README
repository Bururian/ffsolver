This is a simple brute-force solver for Scholar Bear's Math Game in Final
Fantasy: The 4 Heroes of Light. I wrote it a while back for personal use, but
figured I might as well put it out there in case anyone's interested.

To use it, enter the four numbers provided by the game into standard input. The
program will print out the sequence of operations needed to achieve the optimal
score, or tell you if there's no solution. To terminate the program, input a
zero. Sorry it's a little clunky to use, but I didn't originally intend it for
public distribution, and this method is convenient for using the program while
playing the game.

On a side note, you can reliably achieve high scores by just passing on problems
over and over. The game seems to generate enough unsolvable problems that the
bonuses for passing unsolvable problems outweigh the penalties for skipping
solvable ones.
